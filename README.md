in day to day life when some people have alot of enthusiams, introverts find it difficult to interact. being on line and being async helps but still some people can still find it challenging. that being being said im not saying its a problem and i havnt seen any specific examples of it but im not looking out for them


i suppose i need to think how i comminicate more than you. i find it difficult being challenged especially by some people. That situation with gus on the CRDAO thread for example. I know i can be combatative so  im trying to take my time and think carefully how i respond to in those situations
